# themer-prototypes
This repository contains early prototyping and experimental work for adding a Card theming feature.

The goal is to get a sense of which browser-based code editors would be helpful for us when adding a theming option to the Card Builder.
The outcome will be the creation of a new, separate package that integrates with the Cardstack ecosystem.
At that point, this repository will be archived.
